## Notes for Claude Code

- This is a **documentation-only repository** - no executable code or tests to run
- When making edits, preserve the educational structure and flow
- Code snippets within the documentation should be treated as examples for learning
- The curriculum is designed to be progressive - early weeks build foundation for later topics
- External links to learning resources (Exercism, FreeCodeCamp, etc.) are integral to the program
